Interactive Survey Data Analysis Dashboard                    [Month Year]
Individual Project | Streamlit, Plotly, pandas, Python

• Developed comprehensive web-based analytics dashboard analyzing 140 student survey 
  responses across 11 key variables (demographics, preferences, professional background)
• Created 11 distinct visualization modules using Plotly Express with interactive charts, 
  unique color schemes, and smart category ordering for optimal data presentation
• Implemented 3-stage analytics pipeline: univariate analysis with modal/median calculations, 
  correlation analysis with Pearson coefficients, and automated insights generation
• Built advanced features including regex-based age interval parsing, jittered scatter plots 
  for binary data, and aggregate variable analysis combining 20 subcategories
• Discovered actionable insights: IT sector dominance (40%), strong online learning preference 
  among tech professionals (80-90%), generational education trends, and social learning patterns

  refinement, learning format personalization, and motivation-based messaging strategies
• Technologies: Python, Streamlit, Plotly, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, regex

================================================================================
TECHNICAL INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:
================================================================================

1. COMPLEX SORTING ALGORITHM:
   "I implemented a sophisticated age interval parser using regex and tuple sorting. 
   The challenge was handling multiple formats: '<18', '18-24', '25-34', '65+'. 
   I created a sort_key function that returns tuples like (-1, 0, 18) for '<18' 
   and (1, 65, inf) for '65+', ensuring proper ordering across format variations."

2. AGGREGATE VARIABLE ANALYSIS:
   "For hobby, learning, and motivation variables, I had 20 binary columns to aggregate. 
   I created a sum_missing() function that calculates missing data across column groups, 
   and visualizations that sum these binaries to show preference counts. This approach 
   allows both individual subcategory analysis and high-level aggregate insights."

3. JITTERED SCATTER PLOTS:
   "When visualizing correlations between binary variables (teamwork vs workshops), 
   I added random jitter with np.random.normal(0, 0.05) to separate overlapping points. 
   This technique reveals density patterns that would be invisible in a standard 
   scatter plot of 0s and 1s."

4. CORRELATION INTERPRETATION:
   "I built automatic correlation strength interpretation: <0.3 is weak, 0.3-0.7 is 
   moderate, >0.7 is strong. For the age-education correlation, I found moderate 
   positive correlation, indicating younger students tend to have higher education - 
   a key insight for program marketing."

5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   "I used @st.cache_data decorator to cache the CSV load operation. With 140 rows 
   and 28 columns, this prevents redundant file reads on every UI interaction. The 
   cache invalidates automatically if the file changes, ensuring data freshness."

6. UI/UX DESIGN DECISIONS:
   "I chose a three-stage structure: exploration, univariate analysis, correlations, 
   and insights. Each stage builds on the previous, guiding users through increasing 
   analytical complexity. The sidebar provides non-intrusive controls while the main 
   area focuses on visualizations and insights."
