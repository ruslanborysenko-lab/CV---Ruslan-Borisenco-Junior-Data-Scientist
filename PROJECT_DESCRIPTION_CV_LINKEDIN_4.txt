AI Chatbot Web Application                                   [Month Year]

================================================================================
TECHNICAL INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:
================================================================================

1. ARCHITECTURE DECISION - FILE-BASED STORAGE:
   "We chose JSON file-based storage over a traditional database for this prototype 
   because it's simple, human-readable for debugging, and sufficient for a team or 
   personal use application. Each conversation is a separate file, making backups 
   and data inspection trivial. For production scale, we'd migrate to PostgreSQL 
   or MongoDB, but the modular design makes that swap straightforward."

2. MEMORY WINDOW OPTIMIZATION:
   "We implemented a 20-message memory window to balance conversation context with 
   token costs. Sending the full history on every API call would be expensive for 
   long conversations. 20 messages provides enough context for coherent responses 
   while reducing costs by ~60%. We track all token usage for cost monitoring."

3. SESSION STATE MANAGEMENT:
   "Streamlit's session state is key to this application. We store four main pieces: 
   conversation ID, name, messages array, and AI personality. When users switch 
   conversations, we load from JSON into session state and trigger a UI refresh with 
   st.rerun(). All changes persist immediately to disk."

4. ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:
   "We implemented defensive programming throughout - the app creates the database 
   folder structure automatically on first run, handles corrupted JSON files gracefully, 
   and falls back to defaults when files are missing. This 'zero-configuration' approach 
   means users can just run the app without setup steps."

5. TEAM COLLABORATION APPROACH:
   "We coordinated through clear function boundaries and consistent documentation. 
   Each team member owned specific features (e.g., conversation management, UI design, 
   API integration) and we integrated code using Git. Shared API key management was 
   handled through environment variables to avoid conflicts."

6. COST OPTIMIZATION:
   "Beyond the memory window, we track prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, and 
   total_tokens for every API call. This data helps us understand usage patterns 
   and identify optimization opportunities. We also use efficient system prompts 
   and batch messages in single API calls."
