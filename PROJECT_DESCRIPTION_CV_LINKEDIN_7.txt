TECHNICAL INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:
================================================================================

1. VECTOR SEARCH ARCHITECTURE:
   "We use OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model to generate 3072-dimensional vectors 
   for each note. These high-dimensional vectors capture semantic meaning, not just 
   keywords. When searching, we embed the query using the same model and perform 
   cosine similarity search in Qdrant. This finds notes with similar meaning even 
   if they don't share exact words."

2. MD5 CACHING STRATEGY:
   "To optimize costs, we hash audio bytes with MD5 when recording. If the user 
   re-records, we check if the hash changed. If not, we reuse the previous 
   transcription instead of calling Whisper again. This prevents users from 
   accidentally triggering multiple transcriptions of the same audio, which would 
   waste API credits."

3. AUDIO PROCESSING PIPELINE:
   "We capture audio in the browser using streamlit-audiorecorder, which returns 
   AudioSegment objects. We export to BytesIO as MP3 format using pydub and FFmpeg. 
   This in-memory approach avoids disk I/O. The BytesIO stream is sent directly to 
   Whisper API, keeping everything fast and stateless."

4. QDRANT COLLECTION DESIGN:
   "Our Qdrant collection uses 3072-dimensional vectors with cosine distance metric. 
   We chose cosine over euclidean because it measures angle similarity, which works 
   better for normalized embeddings. The collection auto-creates on first run with 
   proper validation to prevent conflicts."

5. STREAMLIT CLOUD DEPLOYMENT:
   "We built a dual-configuration system: dotenv for local development and Streamlit 
   secrets for cloud deployment. The app checks st.secrets first, then falls back to 
   .env variables. This allows seamless local-to-cloud transitions without code changes. 
   API keys are never committed to the repository."

6. SESSION STATE MANAGEMENT:
   "We manage five session state variables: API key, audio bytes, audio MD5, audio 
   transcription, and editable note text. This architecture keeps the UI stateful 
   across interactions while maintaining a stateless backend. The @st.cache_resource 
   decorator ensures we only create one Qdrant client instance."
